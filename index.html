          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This sketch visualizes a 9–5 workday by mapping time to the coffee level in a cup. It is designed for
              users in a cafe or study environment, or individuals working a typical 9–5 schedule, who want a more visual sense 
              of time passing throughout the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> One key decision was mapping time to the coffee level in a cup, since this reflects a familiar 
              daily experience and makes time more intuitive. I also kept the layout simple by using a minimal cup graphic with labeled reference 
              times so the visualization remains easy to read and not visually cluttered (9:00 am, 1:00 pm, 5:00pm). I also included a hover interaction 
              that reveals the exact time just in case users can’t tell based on the markers alone. </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I would add small animations or transitions to strengthen the sense of progression throughout 
              the day. I would also explore allowing users to customize the time range or adjust visual settings to better support accessibility and different 
              schedules.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This sketch visualizes time of day for people studying in a cafe setting by utilizing 
              different colors to match the ambiance of the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> One key decision was combining a traditional analog clock with a surrounding 
              color ring so users can still read time normally while also perceiving time of day through color. I chose cool, neutral, 
              and warm tones to map morning, afternoon, and evening because these color associations are intuitive and easy to 
              interpret at a glance. I also kept the layout simple and uncluttered so the visual glow remains the primary cue.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I would allow users to customize color palettes or brightness 
              levels to better match their environment or accessibility needs.  I would also explore letting users control how 
              many time intervals are represented by adjusting the number of colors shown.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is designed for students or anyone using a Pomodoro study/work routine, 
              particularly in a cafe or focused work environment. It is intended to help users track focus and break intervals 
              in a more engaging way by visualizing time through the familiar process of making coffee.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> One key decision was mapping timer progress to coffee filling a cup, reflecting 
              the Pomodoro technique. I also centered the espresso machine layout so the interaction focus remains on the cup and drip animation. 
              I also used warm, neutral coffee tones and simple control buttons to maintain readability and accessibility on a laptop screen, while 
              including a numeric countdown so users don’t rely solely on visual interpretation.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I would like to add a feature that tracks completed cycles. This way, the user will know 
              how many intervals they have completed in their study session. I would also like to explore allowing the user to customize the timer based 
              on their preferences and needs. </li>
